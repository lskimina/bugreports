### About me ###
My name is Łukasz Skimina. Currently, I am working toward my ISTQB Foundation Level certificate. I am also at the finish line to complete 100% of the uTest Academy course where apart from learning theory I also attended my first test cycles. My goal is to develop testing knowledge and technical skills to become a fully qualified QA specialist. On this site, I would like to share my all gained experience from personal studies and research.
