### About me ###
My name is Łukasz Skimina. I am an enthusiast in the IT industry and I would like to share my passion and dedication for software testing, with a particular emphasis on SQL proficiency. Although my experience is still at an early stage, I have had the opportunity to actively develop my skills on the uTest platform for three months.

During my short but intensive journey in testing, I focused on learning how to create test cases and scenarios, as well as reporting bugs. Additionally, I gained knowledge in SQL language and the basics of designing relational databases.

My determination and eagerness for development are crucial to me, which is why I constantly strive to expand my skills in software testing and SQL database management.

I am confident that my commitment and openness to learning will allow me to quickly advance in this field and contribute to the improvement of IT product quality.
